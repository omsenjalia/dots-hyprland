## [FIX] WiFi Status Flickering (MT7921 P2P Device)

**Date:** 2026-04-21

### What changed

Fixed network status flickering caused by the MediaTek MT7921 WiFi driver creating a virtual `wifi-p2p` device (p2p-dev-wlan0) alongside the primary WiFi interface. The Quickshell network service was detecting both devices:
- `wifi:connected` (primary wlan0 - should count)
- `wifi-p2p:disconnected` (virtual P2P device - incorrectly caused "disconnected" status)

Changed the device type detection from `line.includes("wifi:")` to `line.startsWith("wifi:") && !line.startsWith("wifi-p2p:")` to only track physical WiFi interfaces.

### Files affected

#### Modified
- `ii/services/Network.qml` — Line 195: Exclude wifi-p2p virtual devices from WiFi status detection

### How to verify

```bash
# Check your network device types
nmcli -t -f TYPE,STATE d status

# Should show (without wifi-p2p interference):
# wifi:connected
# loopback:unmanaged

# Previously (caused flickering):
# wifi:connected
# wifi-p2p:disconnected  <-- Now ignored
```

## [FIX] System Settings Persistence

**Date:** 2026-03-30

### What changed

Fixed an issue where changes made in the new System Settings app (`SystemSettings.qml`) were not being saved to `config.json` because deeply nested property modifications in QML do not trigger `JsonAdapter` update signals. Added an explicit `save()` wrapper to `Config.qml` and appended it to all input property changes.

### Files affected

#### Modified
- `ii/modules/common/Config.qml` — Added an explicit `save()` function that calls `configFileView.writeAdapter()`.
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/*.qml` (`MouseSettings`, `KeyboardSettings`, `PowerSettings`, `DisplaySettings`, `AudioSettings`, `DateTimeSettings`) — Appended `Config.save()` to the `onValueChanged`, `onCheckedChanged`, and `onTextChanged` signal handlers of all settings inputs.

## [NEW] Power Profile Cycling (Fn+Q)

**Date:** 2026-03-30

### What changed

Added a **Power Profile Service** that lets you cycle between Power Saver → Balanced → Performance with **Fn+Q** (or via IPC). Shows a desktop notification on each switch. Also added a full profile selector UI to the System Settings → Power page.

### Files affected

#### New
- `ii/services/PowerProfileService.qml` — Singleton with `GlobalShortcut`, `IpcHandler`, cycle/set functions, notify-send feedback

#### Modified
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/PowerSettings.qml` — Added Power Profile section with radio-style profile selector and Fn+Q tip
- `custom/keybinds.conf` — Added `XF86Launch4` → `qs ipc call powerProfile cycle` binding

### How to run

```bash
# Fn+Q on your keyboard (if XF86Launch4 maps correctly — use `wev` to check)
# Or via IPC:
qs ipc call powerProfile cycle

# Or set directly:
qs ipc call powerProfile set balanced
qs ipc call powerProfile set performance
qs ipc call powerProfile set power-saver

# Requires power-profiles-daemon:
yay -S power-profiles-daemon
sudo systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon
```

## [NEW] System Settings App + Feature Modules

**Date:** 2026-03-30

### What changed

A comprehensive KDE/GNOME-style **System Settings** app (`SystemSettings.qml`) with a 3-column layout (categories → pages → content). It integrates both **system-level controls** (Display, Audio, Network, Bluetooth, Keyboard, Mouse, Power, Date & Time, Users) and the **existing dotfiles shell configurator** pages — all in one unified app.

Additionally, three new feature modules were added:
1. **Wallpaper Slideshow** — auto-rotate wallpapers from a folder on a timer
2. **YouTube Downloader** — download videos/audio via yt-dlp with queue + progress
3. **Quick Tools** — one-click system maintenance scripts (update packages, clear cache, etc.)

### Files affected

#### New services
- `ii/services/WallpaperSlideshow.qml` — Slideshow timer singleton, persists config
- `ii/services/YtDownloader.qml` — yt-dlp wrapper with queue management

#### New settings pages (dotfiles configurator tabs)
- `ii/modules/settings/WallpaperSlideshowConfig.qml` — slideshow toggle, interval, folder picker
- `ii/modules/settings/YtDownloaderConfig.qml` — download path, quality, format
- `ii/modules/settings/ToolsConfig.qml` — quick scripts (update, clean, reload)

#### New system settings pages (SystemSettings.qml)
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/DisplaySettings.qml` — monitors, brightness, compositor, night light
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/AudioSettings.qml` — volume, mute, device selection
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/NetworkSettings.qml` — Wi-Fi toggle, scan, network list
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/BluetoothSettings.qml` — on/off, manager link
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/DateTimeSettings.qml` — time/date format, pomodoro timer
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/UsersSettings.qml` — current user info, password change
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/KeyboardSettings.qml` — layout info, on-screen keyboard
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/MouseSettings.qml` — scroll settings, dead pixel workaround
- `ii/modules/sysSettings/PowerSettings.qml` — battery thresholds, suspend, lock screen

#### New panel modules
- `ii/modules/ii/YtDownloaderPanel.qml` — URL input + download queue with progress bars
- `ii/modules/ii/EmojiPickerPanel.qml` — fuzzy search emoji grid, copy on click

#### Modified files
- `ii/settings.qml` — added Slideshow, Downloader, Tools tabs to nav-rail
- `ii/shell.qml` — added `Emojis.load()` to startup
- `ii/SystemSettings.qml` — **new** main entry point for the full system settings app

### How to run

```bash
# Run the full System Settings app (KDE/GNOME-style with system + shell settings)
quickshell -p ~/.config/quickshell/ii/SystemSettings.qml

# Run the shell configurator only (original settings with new tabs)
quickshell -p ~/.config/quickshell/ii/settings.qml

# The slideshow and YT downloader services auto-load with the main shell:
quickshell  # (normal shell launch, services start automatically)
```

### Dependencies

```bash
# YouTube Downloader requires yt-dlp
yay -S yt-dlp

# Browse button in slideshow uses zenity (optional)
yay -S zenity

# Tools page scripts assume: yay, paccache, fastfetch, ncdu, btop (most already installed)
```
